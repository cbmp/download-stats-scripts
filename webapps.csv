Haibe-Kains,Webapp,PharmacoDB,pharmacodb,An integrative database for mining in vitro anticancer drug screening studies,"High throughput drug screening technologies have enabled the profiling of hundreds of cancer cell lines to a large variety of small molecules to discover novel and repurposed treatments. Several large studies have been publicly released testing candidate molecules, often with corresponding molecular profiles of the cell lines used for drug screening. These studies have become invaluable resources for the research community, allowing researchers to leverage the collected data to support their own research. However, such pharmacogenomic datasets are disparate and lack of standardization for cell line and drug identifiers, and used heterogeneous data format for the drug sensitivity measurements.",1.1.0,"Petr Smirnov, Victor Kofia, Alexander Maru, Mark Freeman, Chantal Ho, Nehme El-Hachem, George-Alexandru Adam, Wail Ba-alawi, Zhaleh Safikhani, Benjamin Haibe-Kains","PharmacoDB, cell lines, drug screening, molecular profiles, datasets, pharmacogenomics, annotations, drug sensitivity, visualization",GPLv3,"Smirnov, P., Kofia, V., Maru, A., Freeman, M., Ho, C., El-Hachem, N., ... & Haibe-Kains, B.

Haibe-Kains,Webapp,SYNERGxDB,synergxdb,A comprehensive database to explore synergistic drug combinations for biomarker discovery.,"Many studies have highlighted the use of drug combination approaches in the treatment of tumors, which have been shown to provide aid in overcoming cancer treatment failures. However, the impact of genetics on variability in combo responses for discovering predictive and prognostic biomarkers is currently unknown. To help solve this issue, we created SYNERGxDB, a web-application that possesses the largest database of seven collections of pharmacological and molecular profiles of corresponding cell lines (124 cell lines in 11 tissue types and 1,962 drugs/compounds - 15,268 combinations). This application allows researchers and clinicians to identify novel synergistic drug combinations, in order to discover potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers that can help improve patient prognosis and selection.",,"Heewon Seo, Denis Tkachuk, Benjamin Haibe-Kains","SYNERGxDB, drug combination, biomarkers, datasets, cell lines, molecular profiles, pharmacogenomics, visualization",,Manuscript Under Review,,,,,,https://github.com/bhklab/SYNERGxDB,http://synergxdb.ca/,http://synergxdb.ca/documentation/,

Hoffman,Webapp,DNAmod,dnamod,DNA modification database,"Covalent DNA modifications have been found in numerous organisms and more are continually being discovered and characterized, as detection methods improve. Many of these modifications can affect the conformation of the DNA double helix, often resulting in downstream effects upon transcription factor binding. Some of these modifications have been demonstrated to be stable, while others are viewed as merely transient. DNAmod catalogues information on known DNA modifications, of which the well-known 5-methylcytosine is only one. It aims to profile modifications' properties, building upon data contained within the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database. It also provides literature citations and includes curated annotations on mapping techniques and natural occurrence information.
