'CREAM' uses genome-wide maps of genomic regions in the tissue or cell type of interest, such as those generated from chromatin-based assays including DNaseI, ATAC or ChIP-Seq. 'CREAM' considers proximity of the elements within chromosomes of a given sample to identify COREs in the following steps: 1) It identifies window size or the maximum allowed distance between the elements within each CORE, 2) It identifies number of elements which should be clustered as a CORE, 3) It calls COREs, 4) It filters the COREs with lowest order which does not pass the threshold considered in the approach.",1.1.1,"Seyed Ali Madani Tonekaboni, Victor Kofia, Mathieu Lupien, Benjamin Haibe-Kains","CREAM, clusters, genomic regions, chromosomes, cis-regulatory, R",GPL (≥ 3),"Tonekaboni, S.

Haibe-Kains,Software,PymRMRe,pymrmre,Parallelized minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance ensemble feature selection,"""Feature selection is an important problem for pattern classification systems. We study how to select good features according
to the maximal statistical dependency criterion based on mutual information. Because of the difficulty in directly implementing the
maximal dependency condition, we first derive an equivalent form, called minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion (mRMR), for
first-order incremental feature selection. Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more
sophisticated feature selectors (e.g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform
extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector
machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and
lymphoma tissues). The results confirm that mRMR leads to promising improvement on feature selection and classification accuracy"" (Peng, Long and Ding; 2005) ",0.1.8,Francesco G. Brundu,"PymRMRe, Python, mRMR, feature selection",MIT License,-,2019,"-

Pugh,Software,ConsensusCruncher,consensuscruncher,Suppresses errors in next-generation sequencing data by using unique molecular identifiers,"Detection of cancer-associated somatic mutations has broad applications for oncology and precision medicine. However, this becomes challenging when cancer-derived DNA is in low abundance, such as in impure tissue specimens or in circulating cell-free DNA. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is particularly prone to technical artefacts that can limit the accuracy for calling low-allele-frequency mutations. State-of-the-art methods to improve detection of low-frequency mutations often employ unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) for error suppression; however, these methods are highly inefficient as they depend on redundant sequencing to assemble consensus sequences. Here, we present a novel strategy to enhance the efficiency of UMI-based error suppression by retaining single reads (singletons) that can participate in consensus assembly. This ‘Singleton Correction’ methodology outperformed other UMI-based strategies in efficiency, leading to greater sensitivity with high specificity in a cell line dilution series. Significant benefits were seen with Singleton Correction at sequencing depths ≤16 000×. We validated the utility and generalizability of this approach in a cohort of >300 individuals whose peripheral blood DNA was subjected to hybrid capture sequencing at ∼5000× depth. Singleton Correction can be incorporated into existing UMI-based error suppression workflows to boost mutation detection accuracy, thus improving the cost-effectiveness and clinical impact of NGS.",-,"Ting Ting Wang,  Sagi Abelson,  Jinfeng Zou,  Tiantian Li,  Zhen Zhao,  John E Dick,  Liran I Shlush,  Trevor J Pugh, Scott V Bratman","ConsensusCruncher, UMI-based error suppression, singleton, NGS, Python","Apache License, Version 2.0","Wang, T.

Pugh,Software,Bamgineer,bamgineer,"Simulation of user-defined, allele-specific copy number events into bam files.","Somatic copy number variations (CNVs) play a crucial role in development of many human cancers. The broad availability of next-generation sequencing data has enabled the development of algorithms to computationally infer CNV profiles from a variety of data types including exome and targeted sequence data; currently the most prevalent types of cancer genomics data. However, systemic evaluation and comparison of these tools remains challenging due to a lack of ground truth reference sets. To address this need, we have developed Bamgineer, a tool written in Python to introduce user-defined, haplotype-phased, allele-specific copy number events into an existing Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) files, with a focus on targeted and exome sequencing experiments. As input, this tool requires a read alignment file (BAM format), lists of non-overlapping genome coordinates for introduction of gains and losses (bed file), and an optional file defining known haplotypes (vcf format). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006080",2,"Soroush Samadian, Jeff P.
